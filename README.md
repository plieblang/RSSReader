# RSSReader

# Known ~~bugs~~ features

* Crashes when deleting a feed and when the user then visits the subscribe view before another feed
* Horizontal view is messed up, including the Subscribe button being hidden by the keyboard and the table cells not stretching all the way across
* Cannot subscribe to non-HTTPS feeds
* Feed title does not show up for a long time after subscribing

#Less urgent missing features
* Make entering a feed url easier, perhaps by allowing the omission of the "http(s)://"
