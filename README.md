# RSSReader

# Known ~~bugs~~ features

* Horizontal view is messed up, including the Subscribe button being hidden by the keyboard and the table cells not stretching all the way across
* Setting a feed's title works inconsistently so for now it's set to its URL

# Less urgent missing features
* Make entering a feed url easier, perhaps by allowing the omission of the "http(s)://"
* Ordering of feeds and articles is unknown; seems to be by date but might not be
